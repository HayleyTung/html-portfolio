<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hayley (Yu Ying Tung). Currently, I work as an installation engineer at JEOL. I immigrated to the Fiji Islands when I was little, which provided me with the ability to speak Mandarin and English fluently. I pursued a major in Microbiology, Immunology, and Biopharmaceuticals at National Chiayi University. Although I enjoyed my studies, I realized that laboratory work was not what I truly desired.This realization led me to the semiconductor industry, which I believe offers immense potential and opportunities for development. </p>
